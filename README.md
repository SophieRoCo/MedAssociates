# MedAssociates
MedPC Codes for operant chamber experiments used in the España Lab at Drexel University

*Background*
Our lab performs intravenous self-administration experiments in rats using the MedAssociates operant chambers. We utilize several schedules of reinforcement and have included all of our codes here for others to use! Please note that these codes are written based on the doses that we use in the lab and should be calculated based on YOUR DOSAGE. For all programs, the pump time is dependent on the weight of the animal in grams which must be input manually at the start of each session.
